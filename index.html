            Hi, I’m Boris Heijliger-Krogulski — a data analyst with a strong academic foundation in Mathematics and Actuarial Science, and hands-on experience across ESG analysis, insurance, and financial modelling. I use tools like Python, R, and Excel to turn complex data into clear, actionable insights, and I enjoy communicating these insights in ways that make sense to both technical and non-technical audiences.
            <br><br>
            I’ve worked on pricing life assurance products, contributed to sustainability-focused research projects in the insurance market, and gained firsthand experience in underwriting at Lloyd’s of London. Originally from South East Asia and educated through the British system (IGCSEs, A-Levels, and postgraduate study at Bayes Business School), I bring a global outlook and an ability to adapt quickly in dynamic environments.
            <br><br>
            Curious by nature and quick to learn, I’m always looking to grow — whether it’s picking up a new skill, diving into a dataset, or collaborating on a project that makes a real impact.
