        <h2>Project 1: Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>This document is an individual coursework task related to predicting coronary heart disease (CHD) for males in a high-risk region of the Western Cape, South Africa. The dataset includes nine features such as systolic blood pressure, tobacco use, cholesterol levels, and family history of heart disease. The tasks involve exploratory data analysis, logistic regression with ridge penalty, and exploring other classifiers to achieve the highest accuracy..</p>

        <h2>Project 2: Analytics Methods for Business</h2>
        <p>I was tasked with an individual assignment is to analyse the ‘HousePrices’ data frame, which includes information on 546 house sales in Windsor, Canada, from July to September 1987. The data frame presents various variables such as price, lotsize, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, driveway, recreation, fullbase, gasheat, aircon, garage, and prefer. My analysis aims to model the sale price as a function of these variables or a subset of them. In my report, I will justify my chosen regression model and discuss its assumptions. I will provide a summary of the results using tables and figures, interpreting the empirical findings. Additionally, I will comment on the limitations of my analysis and suggest improvements.</p>
