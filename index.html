        <p>
            Hi, I’m Boris Heijliger-Krogulski — a data analyst with a strong academic foundation in Mathematics and Actuarial Science, and hands-on experience across ESG analysis, insurance, and financial modelling. I use tools like Python, R, and Excel to turn complex data into clear, actionable insights, and I enjoy communicating these insights in ways that make sense to both technical and non-technical audiences.
            <br><br>
            I’ve worked on pricing life assurance products, contributed to sustainability-focused research projects in the insurance market, and gained firsthand experience in underwriting at Lloyd’s of London. Curious by nature and quick to learn, I’m always looking to grow — whether it’s picking up a new skill, diving into a dataset, or collaborating on a project that makes a real impact.

            <strong>SMM062: Finance and Financial Reporting (Subject CB1)</strong>
            <br>  I gained essential skills to engage professionally with corporate finance and financial reporting. I gained a clear understanding of how companies raise finance, corporate structure, and various financial instruments. I learned to construct and interpret financial statements, and applied accounting ratios to evaluate financial performance. This module enhanced my ability to analyse complex financial data and communicate findings effectively, supporting my progress to CB1 accreditation.

            <strong>SMM092: Modelling Practice</strong>
            <br> In this module, I developed practical skills in actuarial modelling using Excel, focusing on constructing, documenting, and analysing models in Excel to solve real-world problems. I learned to maintain clear audit trails (TAS100), perform reasonableness checks, and communicate modelling approaches and results effectively in technical reports. The module emphasized systematic model design, ethical considerations, and the importance of transparent documentation, preparing me for professional actuarial work and gaining CP2 accreditation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>SMM284: Applied Machine Learning</strong>
            <br> This module introduced me to practical machine learning techniques, with hands-on experience using Python. I learned to implement and adapt a range of models including penalised regression, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods. The course covered key concepts such as loss functions, bias-variance trade-off, regularisation, and hyper-parameter tuning. I also explored unsupervised learning techniques like PCA and gained an introduction to neural networks and deep learning, applying these methods through real-world case studies and projects.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>SMM695: Data Management Systems</strong>
            <br> In this module, I developed practical skills in designing and managing databases using both relational (PostgreSQL) and schema-free (MongoDB) systems. I learned to interact with and manipulate data through SQL, JavaScript, and Python scripts. The course emphasized applying these skills to real-world datasets via a group project, where I designed effective data solutions and clearly communicated my approach and findings. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of data management frameworks and practical data analytics.

            <strong>MA1801 Finance I: Financial Markets and Corporate Financial Management</strong>
            <br> Gained an understanding of financial systems, institutions, and instruments, including the differences between equity and debt. I applied the time value of money to financial decisions and used investment appraisal methods like NPV and IRR to evaluate projects. I also explored capital structure, budgeting, dividend policy, and share repurchases, learning how these influence firm value and financial strategy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>MA2800 Finance II: Investment Management</strong>
            <br> Building on Finance I, this module deepened my understanding of investment theory and financial markets. I analysed risk and return, applied portfolio theory, and studied asset pricing models including Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) & Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT). I critically evaluated equity valuation methods and explored bond pricing techniques such as duration analysis and yield spreads. The module also covered the Efficient Market Hypothesis and the dynamics of equity markets.
