        <p>
            Hi, I’m Boris Heijliger-Krogulski — a data analyst with a strong academic foundation in Mathematics and Actuarial Science, and hands-on experience across ESG analysis, insurance, and financial modelling. I use tools like Python, R, and Excel to turn complex data into clear, actionable insights, and I enjoy communicating these insights in ways that make sense to both technical and non-technical audiences.
            <br><br>
            I’ve worked on pricing life assurance products, contributed to sustainability-focused research projects in the insurance market, and gained firsthand experience in underwriting at Lloyd’s of London. Curious by nature and quick to learn, I’m always looking to grow — whether it’s picking up a new skill, diving into a dataset, or collaborating on a project that makes a real impact.

    <h2>Modules Taken</h2>
    <ul class="modules-list">
        <li>
            <strong>MA1801 Finance I: Financial Markets and Corporate Financial Management </strong>
            <br> Gained an understanding of financial systems, institutions, and instruments, including the differences between equity and debt. I applied the time value of money to financial decisions and used investment appraisal methods like NPV and IRR to evaluate projects. I also explored capital structure, budgeting, dividend policy, and share repurchases, learning how these influence firm value and financial strategy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>MA2800 Finance II: Investment Management</strong>
            <br> Building on Finance I, this module deepened my understanding of investment theory and financial markets. I analysed risk and return, applied portfolio theory, and studied asset pricing models including Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) & Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT). I critically evaluated equity valuation methods and explored bond pricing techniques such as duration analysis and yield spreads. The module also covered the Efficient Market Hypothesis and the dynamics of equity markets.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>MA2601: Operational Research</strong>
            <br> Intorucing key analytical techniques used in decision-making, including Queueing Theory, Simulation, Linear Programming, and Network Analysis. I modelled real-life systems using stochastic processes, evaluated queue performance and costs, and conducted basic simulations using random sampling. I formulated and solved linear programming problems using the simplex and stepping stone methods, and applied network models to shortest path, critical path, and maximum flow problems. The focus throughout was on applying mathematical methods to optimise practical systems.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>MA3503: Stochastic Processes for Finance and Insurance</strong>
            <br> I studied key stochastic models including random walks, Markov chains, Poisson processes, and Brownian motion, focusing on their applications in finance and insurance. I applied models such as the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein and Black-Scholes formulae for option pricing, and used Markov chains to analyse No Claim Discounting in motor insurance. I also explored the fundamentals of risk theory, including the Cramér-Lundberg approximation, and evaluated distributional properties and financial contract values using stochastic methods.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>MA3504: Official Statistics</strong>
            <br> This module covered practical statistical skills used in government and policy-making, focusing on survey design and analysis. I studied sampling methods, estimation techniques for population totals, and regression estimation. I learned how to adjust for non-response using weighting and calibration methods, and explored index number theory for comparing prices and quantities over time. Guest lectures from Office for National Statistics practitioners provided valuable real-world insights into the application of official statistics.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>MA3506: Multivariate Data Analysis</strong>
            <br>  I gained a deep understanding of multivariate probability and statistics, with a focus on the multivariate Gaussian distribution. I applied kernel regression techniques, an important tool in machine learning, and explored classical topics in multivariate statistics. Alongside the theory, I developed practical skills by implementing models and analysing multivariate data using R or Python, enhancing both my programming and technical communication abilities.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>MA3602: Algorithms and Heuristics</strong>
            <br> deepened the understanding of combinatorial optimisation, focusing on graph and network problems such as shortest paths, spanning trees, and maximum flow. I studied exact algorithms like Dijkstra’s and Prim’s, as well as heuristic and metaheuristic methods—including simulated annealing and evolutionary algorithms—for tackling NP-complete problems. I also learned to analyse problem intractability and design heuristics to solve complex operational research challenges efficiently.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>MA3603: Optimisation</strong>
            <br> introduced the mathematical foundations of optimisation, covering both linear and nonlinear problems. I learned to apply the Simplex method for linear programming and explored branch and bound techniques for integer programming. The course covered concepts of convexity, dynamic programming for deterministic and stochastic problems, and geometric interpretations such as polyhedra and discrete geometry theorems. I also studied cutting plane methods and lattice basis reduction, enabling me to model and solve a variety of classical optimisation problems.
