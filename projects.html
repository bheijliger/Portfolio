        <h2>Project 1: Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>This document is an individual coursework task related to predicting coronary heart disease (CHD) for males in a high-risk region of the Western Cape, South Africa. The dataset includes nine features such as systolic blood pressure, tobacco use, cholesterol levels, and family history of heart disease. The tasks involve exploratory data analysis, logistic regression with ridge penalty, and exploring other classifiers to achieve the highest accuracy..</p>

        <h2>Project 2: Analytics Methods for Business</h2>
        <p>I was tasked with an individual assignment is to analyse the ‘HousePrices’ data frame, which includes information on 546 house sales in Windsor, Canada, from July to September 1987. The data frame presents various variables such as price, lotsize, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, driveway, recreation, fullbase, gasheat, aircon, garage, and prefer. My analysis aims to model the sale price as a function of these variables or a subset of them. In my report, I will justify my chosen regression model and discuss its assumptions. I will provide a summary of the results using tables and figures, interpreting the empirical findings. Additionally, I will comment on the limitations of my analysis and suggest improvements.</p>

        <h2>Project 3: Financial Mathematics CM1(1)</h2>
        <p>I was presented with a series of tasks involving the calculation of mortgage repayments and outstanding balances using various interest rates. I was instructed to show all formulas used in calculations and to construct an Excel spreadsheet to model the mortgage repayment process over a 25-year period. The assessment includes plotting graphs to visualise the mortgage balance over time and calculating the total interest payable. Additionally, it presents a scenario where interest rates rise due to political events, affecting the mortgage calculations..</p>

        <h2>Project 4: Contingencies CM1(2)</h2>
        <p>I was tasked with a Contingencies computer-based assessment, showcasing my proficiency in applying mortality tables and actuarial formulas to real-world scenarios. I demonstrate my ability to extend spreadsheets for mortality rates, calculate commutation functions, and determine premiums for life insurance policies, as well as reserves.</p>
